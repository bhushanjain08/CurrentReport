            This script was somewhat controversial… Mark Wahlberg originally didn’t want the role, after seeing how
            Showgirls had tanked. He changed his mind after reading the screenplay. William H. Macy’s agent didn’t want
            him
            to take the part. Macy read the script, loved it, and immediately signed up. Burt Reynolds did the same but
            later regretted it and fired his agent for recommending the role to him.
