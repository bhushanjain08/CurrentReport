        This script was somewhat controversial… Mark Wahlberg originally didn’t want the role, after seeing how
        Showgirls had tanked. He changed his mind after reading the screenplay. William H. Macy’s agent didn’t want him
        to take the part. Macy read the script, loved it, and immediately signed up. Burt Reynolds did the same but
        later regretted it and fired his agent for recommending the role to him.
